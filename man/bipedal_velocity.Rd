\title{Calculate Velocity of a Bipedal Animal}
\usage{
bipedal_velocity(leg_length_mm, cadence, stride_ratio, time_constant = 0.0036)
}
\arguments{
\item{leg_length_mm}{Numeric. The length of the animal's leg in millimeters (sum of femur, tibia, and metatarsal III).}

\item{cadence}{Numeric. The cadence of the animal in steps per second (Hz).}

\item{stride_ratio}{Numeric. The stride ratio, which is the proportion between stride length and leg length.}

\item{time_constant}{Numeric. The space-time constant for velocity calculation. Defaults to 0.0036 for results in km/h.}
}
\value{
Numeric. The velocity of the bipedal animal in kilometers per hour (km/h).
}
\description{
This function estimates the velocity of a bipedal animal in km/h based on its leg length, cadence, and stride ratio.
}
\details{
The velocity is calculated using the formula:
\deqn{velocity = (leg\_length\_mm \times cadence \times stride\_ratio) \times time\_constant}

The leg length must be provided in millimeters, and the cadence should be given in steps per second.
The stride ratio is a dimensionless proportion between stride length and leg length.

The \code{time_constant} is set to 0.0036 by default, which converts the result to kilometers per hour (km/h). If results
in meters per second (m/s) are needed, use a \code{time_constant} of 0.001.
}
\note{
Ensure that all input values are positive. This function is designed for paleontological and biomechanical research.
