\title{Calculate Cursoriality Parameters for Theropods}
\usage{
cursoriality_theropod(weight_kg, leg_ratio)
}
\arguments{
\item{weight_kg}{Numeric. The body mass of the theropod in kilograms.}

\item{leg_ratio}{Numeric. The ratio of (Tibia + Metatarsal III) / Femur.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements:
\describe{
\item{Adjusted_Cadence}{Numeric. The cadence adjusted based on both body mass and leg length ratio (steps per second).}
\item{Adjusted_Stride_Ratio}{Numeric. The stride ratio adjusted based on both body mass and leg length ratio.}
}
}
\description{
This function calculates the optimal cadence and stride ratio for theropods based on their body mass and leg length ratio.
}
\details{
The function calculates cursoriality parameters for theropods by considering both their body mass
and leg length proportions. It assigns optimal cadence and stride ratio values based on the weight ranges
of the theropod, which are further adjusted by the ratio of tibia + metatarsal III to femur length.

The cadence (steps per second) and stride ratio (dimensionless value representing the relationship
between stride length and body proportions) are initially determined from the body mass. These values
are then adjusted using a biomechanical scaling factor based on the leg length ratio to refine the estimates.

For theropods heavier than 10,000 kg, the function assumes minimal cursoriality with cadence and stride
ratio values starting at 1. The input leg length ratio must be between 0.9 and 2.8 to ensure accurate
adjustments. Additionally, the total leg length (femur + tibia + metatarsal III) in meters can be used
in subsequent calculations for speed estimation.

This function is designed for paleontological research and educational purposes. The values it provides
are estimates based on general models and may not fully represent specific species.
