\title{Calculate Body Mass Using a Volumetric Formula}
\usage{
volumetric(reference_weight, reference_femur, estimated_femur)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference_weight}{Numeric. The known weight of the reference organism (e.g., in kilograms).}

\item{reference_femur}{Numeric. The femur length of the reference organism (e.g., in centimeters).}

\item{estimated_femur}{Numeric. The femur length of the organism whose mass is being estimated (e.g., in centimeters).}
}
\value{
Numeric. The estimated body mass of the organism (in the same units as the reference weight).
}
\description{
This function estimates the body mass of an organism based on its femur length using a volumetric formula.
}
\details{
This function assumes a cubic scaling relationship between weight and femur size.
It is crucial that the reference weight and femur length are derived from an organism
that is closely related or shares similar anatomical proportions with the organism whose
mass is being estimated. Using unrelated reference data may result in inaccurate estimates.
Ensure that all measurements use consistent units (e.g., kilograms and centimeters).
}
\note{
This function is designed for academic use and paleontological applications.
