Description: This package provides tools and methods to extract and calculate various animal measurements, including body mass, length, speed, and other metrics derived from anatomical features. By leveraging volumetric formulas, scaling principles, and biomechanical models, the package offers robust methods for estimating physical and ecological parameters of extinct species. Designed for paleontological research, `PaleoPackage` supports the analysis of fossil data to reconstruct the biology, behavior, and ecological roles of extinct organisms. The package is particularly suited for researchers, educators, and enthusiasts in the field of paleontology, enabling comparisons across species and facilitating a deeper understanding of evolutionary and ecological trends.
